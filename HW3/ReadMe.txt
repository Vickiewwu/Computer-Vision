#HW3_1.py is for Q1 in HW3. To execute this program, it has to be put in the same directory with the folder "output" and the input images.
The program will read the sources at the same directory and output to the folder "output."
#HW3-2.py is for Q2 in HW3, and the way to execute is the same as HW3-1.py.
#HW3-2.py can currently output the distribution of points in RGB space for "2-image-jpg".
If you want to get the output of the "2-masterpiece.jpg", you need to uncomment line 120 and comment out line 119.
#The images will be shown when the program is running, and after the window of the image is closed will the following codes be executed.
